# Vagrant Build Box for torch-android

[Read my torch-android guide for more info.](https://paramsen.github.io/torch-android-vagrant-build-box)

This Vagrant Box provisions an Ubuntu 14.04 64bit VM with Android SDK/NDK, correct cmake version and other dependencies. After provisioning it builds Torch and torch-android. Finally you can find the built files in `./mounted`.
